1. import random vs from random import * 
    * In case of import random - you will have to use random. to call any function of random modules Example - say random.randomint()
    * In case of from random import * - you don't need to use random. to call any function of random modules. Example - directly say randomint()

2. Every function has a return value. If you don't have a return statement in the function, by default function will return None. Also print function always return None.
