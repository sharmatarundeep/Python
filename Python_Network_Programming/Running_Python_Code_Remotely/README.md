There can be requirements you want to run python code or send commands to a device remotely
1. Case 1 - Running CLI commands via remote server. Create a script on your local PC and this script open a SSH session to a remote server like st101 and from this remote server you create a SSH session to the device and run commands
2. Case 2 - Running a local python script via a remote server. Example run a script present on your laptop via remote server st101.
3. Case 3 - Run the remote script via remote server but from Local Machine like our laptop
