* Python Network Application # 3 - Extracting Network Parameters & Building Graphs.
* Overview - Connect to a network device using ssh, check CPU utilization periodically until interupted to build a database in a text file and later build a graph on CPU utilization. Also, our graph will dynamically update itself in real time.  
* To run the application, open 2 terminal and run NetworkApp.py from one and graph.py from another.
* NetworkApp.py will publish the CPU utilization data in text file every 10 seconds.
* graph.py will continue to plot graph by polling data every 10 seconds in real time.
