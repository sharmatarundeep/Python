# Just a fun game
* Ask someone to guess a number within a range. 
* Once the person starts guessing give some hints like no your guess is too high or low to help person guess the right number. 
* But make sure you don't give infinite chances to guess example a person will get just 5 chances Max. 
* Once the person guess the number right congratulate and tell how many tried he/she took to guess it
