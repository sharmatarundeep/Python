* Python Network Application # 4 - Basic Network Packet Sniffer
* Overview - Capture and decode packets using Scapy module. 
* About scapy - Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation library written in Python. Scapy is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies etc.
* In my case I will use st101 server for this exercise and to run scapy as I am not able to run scapy on DUTs or my Macos because of permissions.
* A few Scapy basics
    - lsc() - To find list of all the functions available in scapy
    - ls() - List of all protocols that scapy support
    - 

Modules used 
* os.path (for check if file exist or not)
* sys (for exiting the program in case of error sys dot exit())
* scapy (for capturing and decoding packets on the network)
